# Road to ml
## basics
(Basics model)[https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/basics] includes some essentially fundamental algorithms,such as bisection, Dijstra, common sort algorithms and so on.
## math
Math model is exactly its seeming name, about math theories, especially about optimization,
linear algebra, probabilty theory.
## python
It is mainly for machine learning and deep learning ,such as decorator, generator, highOrder function, etc and that is 
to say, doesn't include everything knowledge about Python.

## numpy
It is about numpy summaries in practice.


## pandas
It is about pandas summaries in practice.


## ml
This model is mainly about ml skill stack, including feature engineering, pca, common ml algorithms, etc. Importantly, each step
of machine learning is provided the reference materials which are picked up elaborately and have a rank.


## dl
Deep learning part contains theory about cv and nlp. 

## kaggle
This is part in pracitce and contains sorts of practical experience.


## tensorflow
Tensorflow skeleton will be noted from introductory to practical application to projects.
