# Road to ml
## basics
[Basics model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/basics) includes some essentially fundamental algorithms,such as bisection, Dijstra, common sort algorithms and so on.
## math
[Math model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/math) is exactly its seeming name, about math theories, especially about optimization,
linear algebra, probabilty theory.
## python
[Python model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/python) is mainly for machine learning and deep learning ,such as decorator, generator, highOrder function, etc and that is 
to say, doesn't include everything knowledge about Python.

## numpy
[Numpy model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/numpy) is about numpy summaries in practice. Currently including: 
-- [Numpy常见的4个应用场景](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/blob/master/numpy/matric%20searching%20methods.md)

## pandas
[Numpy model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/pandas) is about pandas summaries in practice.


## ml
[ML model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/ml) is mainly about ml skill stack, including feature engineering, pca, common ml algorithms, etc. Importantly, each step
of machine learning is provided the reference materials which are picked up elaborately and have a rank.


## dl
[DL model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/dl),deep learning part contains theory about cv and nlp. 

## kaggle
[Kaggle model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/kaggle/titanic) is about in pracitce and contains sorts of practical experience.


## tensorflow
[Tensorflow model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/tensorflow/get-started), tensorflow skeleton will be noted from introductory to practical application to projects.
