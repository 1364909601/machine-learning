# Road to AI
It is all about practical experience and best study materials for AI
## basics
[Basics model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/basics) includes some essentially fundamental algorithms,such as bisection, Dijstra, common sort algorithms and so on.
## math
[Math model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/math) is exactly its seeming name, about math theories, especially about optimization,
linear algebra, probabilty theory.
## python
[Python model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/python) is mainly for machine learning and deep learning ,such as decorator, generator, highOrder function, etc and that is 
to say, doesn't include everything knowledge about Python.

## numpy
[Numpy model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/numpy) is about numpy summaries in practice, currently including: 
- [Numpy特征工程常见的4个场景](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/blob/master/numpy/matric%20searching%20methods.md)

## pandas
[Numpy model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/pandas) is about pandas summaries in practice.


## ml
[ML model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/ml) is mainly about ml skill stack, including feature engineering, pca, common ml algorithms, etc. Importantly, each step
of machine learning is provided the reference materials which are picked up elaborately, currently including: 
- [单词拼写检查器](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/ml/bayes)

- [决策树做回归和分类及可视化](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/ml/decision-tree)

- [PCA, SVD](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/ml/pca)

- [手写 高斯混合GMM算法](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/blob/master/ml/GMM.ipynb)

- [线性回归](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/blob/master/ml/linear-regression.ipynb)

- [逻辑回归](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/blob/master/ml/logistic-regression.ipynb)

- [xgboost基础入门](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/blob/master/ml/xgboost-basics.ipynb)

## dl
[DL model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/dl),deep learning part contains theory about cv and nlp. 

## kaggle
[Kaggle model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/kaggle/titanic) is about in pracitce and contains sorts of practical experience.


## tensorflow
[Tensorflow model](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/machine-learning/tree/master/tensorflow/get-started), tensorflow skeleton will be noted from introductory to practical application to projects.
